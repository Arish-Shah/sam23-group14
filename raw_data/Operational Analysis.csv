While the export community is relatively small, its impacts to the public are significant. Given the Russia-Ukraine conflict and ongoing tensions with China, we have been called upon to do more. 

There are mission-critical needs to better coordinate and exchange data on license applicants and potential export violators with our US government partners but also develop advanced data sharing and analytics capabilities with our international partners such as Canada and the European Union.  

Within the past year, the Bureau has repositioned its CIO office to focus on technology modernization for both BIS employees and their customers. The first priority is on platform migrations to move systems from legacy on premise data centers into the cloud for data sharing across systems and agency partners. The next priority is to meaningfully integrate design and innovation practices into product development. This includes elevating the voice of BIS customers by standing up a design-led customer experience organization with data and analytics capabilities that enable BIS to proactively respond to internal and external customer needs.  

The CUESS system continues to provide significant value to the exporting community.  Current Metrics meet customer and financial goals with results representing effectiveness of program as a measure of user efficiency and customer shipping authorizations as determined and issued by BIS. It has immediate impact on customer satisfaction as it determines what, where, and when for exporting conditions if approved. An ineffective technical licensing posture would impact global exports of licensed products, weaken the collaborative inter-agency license adjudication process, and cause additional storage cost and lost revenue to American businesses. 

BIS is currently in the process of migrating its CUESS suite of applications to the Microsoft Azure cloud. This is expected to be completed by the third quarter. 

Beginning in the third quarter of FY 2023, BIS plans to initiate modernization efforts to redesign the CUESS suite of applications using native cloud-based technologies.","continue as-is","2023-06-05 16:18:54"

in claims appeals processing. In October of 2019 Pivot had released enough functionality to assume SOR status for the NFIP and began processing all policy and claims transactions for the NFIP. In September of 2020 Pivot achieved FOC after all functional requirements for FOC were satisfied.
In this initial, post-FOC OA, the Study Team identified many program strengths including financial performance, strategic and business alignment, operational performance, innovation, and risk. In particular, the Program excels at financial performance with a compounding ROI, and its innovation efforts are breaking ground for other modernization programs moving to the cloud via agile methodology, in particular. However, some weaknesses were identified by customer satisfaction responses concerning the ability to find info/data a user is seeking, and the Program is actively seeking to improve data quality and analysis via refactoring and future enhancements. The Study Team also identified process and documentation adjustments that would help improve the overall quality and ease of analysis that could be used to improve next year's analysis and reporting.
While there are opportunities for improvement, the Study Team did not identify any Strategic and Tactical Gaps as defined by the DHS Instruction #102-02-002, OA Guidebook. Nonetheless, the Program should continue to enhance the System's intuitiveness and ease of use--particularly with respect to RR2; bolster data quality and analysis capabilities; and
refine processes and documentation used to capture and report system performance.","continue as-is","2022-10-26 13:09:43"

While VM provides its services to its stakeholder free of charge, we have been actively working to reduce the internal costs of each of our services. Starting in FY20, VM has actively worked to transition its services from FFRDCs to private sector Vendors which results in reduced costs. 


Finally, as VM matures as an investment, we are finding creative ways to integrate our activities with our internal partners to ensure that “the whole is greater than the sum of our parts.”  Examples include working with the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to target specific sectors of relevance to them or better sharing information with the CISA Integrated Operations Divisions (IOD).","continue as-is","2021-09-29 14:42:12"

Strategic and Business Results: IDENT continues to be aligned with the DHS goals. The IDENT system provides biometric identity information to DHS and its mission partners by matching, storing, sharing, and analyzing biometric data to provide timely and actionable information to support daily operational decisions impacting national security, immigration and citizenship laws and services, and public safety. 
Financial Performance: Although IDENT has performed well, the system is aging. Therefore, OBIM is pursuing the acquisition and development of a replacement biometric system called HART to continue to provide biometric identity services to support DHS goals and resolve critical system issues with the current IDENT system.   
Operational Performance Measures: For the FY2020 reporting period, four of six operational performance measurements met or exceeded established performance targets. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the normal volume of traveling population was significantly reduced, which in turn cause some anomalies in Traveler Inconvenienced measure (accuracy) and Cost per IDENT transaction measure (Cost efficiency). For FY2021 year-to-date, operational performance continues to be affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic traveling limitations; however, OBIM believes by the end of the fiscal year, traveling patterns should return to normal and performance results in INVEST should return to meet the established performance targets.

Accordingly, this assessment identifies several themes within the Risk MAP IT program.
The current Risk MAP IT program owned systems do not meet the current or anticipated needs of the Risk MAP (no-IT) Program, and within the next two fiscal years, the Risk MAP IT program will need to move from sustainment into an enhancement/modernization phase. This supports both ongoing security vulnerability remediation and future needs of the Risk MAP Program.  The only way for to ensure a sustainable load of security vulnerability remediation is to modernize the infrastructure.  
The Risk MAP IT program is designed to support the large non-IT Risk MAP Program?s IT and data management needs.  As the non-IT program shifts its focus from binary to graduate risk in a future state, Risk MAP IT systems will need to evolve to ensure program IT and data management needs are meet.

TECS Disaster Recovery applications were moved out of DC2 due to reduction ofusage by CBP to another geographically separated data center in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The TECS Program Management Office will also continue to manage identified risks in accordance with established mitigation plans.

These Surveys reflect that CTI’s customers rated their satisfaction as 4.08 out of 5 in overall satisfaction of all elements. Based on comments received in the Surveys, CTI is continuing to provide training and support for areas that cause some users difficulty, namely, the need to enter accounting codes in webTA.
●Strategic and Business Results: This area defines how CTI supports the DHS Strategic Plan 2020-2024, as well as the CBP Strategic Plan 2021-2026. It describes how CTI continues to meet identified business needs, as well as mandates.
●Financial Performance: This area describes that CTI is successfully progressing toward achieving the qualitative and quantitative benefits of the program, and that the full return on investment will occur after full operating capability. CTI is making progress toward its Alternative Results Report goals to achieve efficiencies, a more adaptable and sustainable design for the timekeeping and scheduling system, and a better response to the operational requirements of the CBP mission. CTI’s cost and schedule variance has not exceeded 10% when compared to Program’s baseline.
●Innovation: This area reflects CTI’s work building a new Automated Scheduling Tool (AST) for OFO in the CBP cloud environment (Amazon Web Services). CTI’s AST is a major step forward for OFO and CBP, as OFO’s complex scheduling environment for its 24x7 activities at the U.S. ports of entry have previously been mostly labor-intensive manual processes for daily scheduling activities, and COSS mainframe environment-based green screen processes for annual scheduling activities. The CTI AST innovations will increase efficiencies and reduce the need for manual labor.
●Operational Performance Measures: This area shows how CTI is meeting and exceeding its operational performance targets. CTI has achieved Initial Operational Capability, and plans to achieve Full Operational Capability with the migration of the Office of Field Operations (OFO) to its automated scheduling tool, BESA, and to GovTA in 2023.
●Risk Analysis: This area reflects CTI's understanding of the risks it is facing in the Data, Project Schedule & Resource, Organizational & Change Management, Cost, and Integration categories. The program has developed effective mitigation strategies and contingency plans for each.","continue as-is","2022-08-29 17:44:52"

DEERS provides benefits determination, including education, life insurance, financial protections, and healthcare eligibility and enrollment.


DEERS creates and manages the DoD Identification Number (DoD ID) to ensure accurate data is shared across services, supporting Common Access Card (CAC) issuance, personnel accountability, testing and recruiting, and the transitional assistance management program. DEERS provides authoritative personnel identification, validation and authentication for DoD agencies, the Veteran?s Administration, the US Department of Labor, the US Department of Education, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Commerce, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Office of Personnel Management, the Transportation Security Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, State VA Agencies, State Medicaid, Department of Justice, and the US Congress.


While hundreds of DoD capabilities rely on DEERS for day-to-day operations, the underlying system structures are dated, depending on large amounts of non-integrated data, from multiple sources, in various formats, with different frequencies and levels of quality. DEERS stores more than 50 million records on individuals with current or past affiliations to DoD across 160 distinct databases to support various business capabilities. Consolidating external business lines further increased duplicate data, as will the Veterans Administration use of DoD?s electronic health record, MHS GENESIS, which will require DEERS to absorb ~4 million VA patients into its databases and assume identity management functions for VA.  Such expanded requirements will necessitate enhancements to ensure that DEERS data is more visible, more accessible, more understandable, more trusted, and more interoperable in the future.

The IES Sample Surveys investment is on target with strategic and business goals for FY2019. Monthly CCB meetings continue to keep the project on track and members of the team work together to provide up to date information to the PM.

Performance:
Our metrics in 2019 mostly met their targets. Through the use of more creative social media posts and a new NCES blog, the quality of the content on the public site has well exceeded targets for the past few years and NCES and Sample Surveys are engaging with their audiences. We are keeping most of the 2019 targets for 2020  .

Cost:
In FY2019, all IES Sample Survey projects are on budget and on schedule. There have been no baseline changes to date.

Innovation:
Several subprojects continued to explore the innovating strategies mentioned in previous years as well as generate new innovative strategies, such as converting from paper surveys to web surveys, implementing new quality control systems, generating mobile-optimized survey instruments, and rolling out online training to replace in person training.

Data sources used to conduct analysis:
- Monthly IESSS Team and Change Control/Risk Management Board meeting minutes
- Monthly web content team meetings minutes
- Monthly conference calls between NCES CORs and contractor management staff 	
- Monthly OMB metrics.
- Security reviews with the NCES CORs and the project team to review upgrades and changes to the operational environment and plans for changes in the coming year. 
- The contractor continues to work towards creating templates and repeatable processes so information gathered can be provided efficiently by the program and reported through eCPIC in a timely manner.

They also are doing high quality dissemination work that is driving traffic to their websites. However, the RELs are not able to keep users on the website once they enter and continue to experience a very high bounce rate. Similarly, the cost and attendance of webinars vary, and the cost per webinar attendee continues to be high.

The RELs have tremendous cost and schedule variance, demonstrating that they are not dedicating sufficient resources to planning and completing their website development and maintance. While some of the variance is outside of the RELs control, due to the nature of the program and contract structure, the majority of the cost variance is within control of the contractors. 

IES is shifting the focus of the next set of REL contracts to make the content contracts be non-IT and make all website development and associated project management the responsibility of a separate website contractor. This will increase value to IES, while reducing costs and risk.

ISS continues to meet or exceed its goals which are important to the Department.   By ensuring the EDCAPS systems are ready and available for our customers  use, they are able to get their jobs done efficiently and timely.  We strive for and achieve 100% or near 100% system availability.  

Three years ago, EDCAPS systems began migrating from aging IBM servers running on the AIX operating system to less expensive DELL X86 servers running the Red Hat Linux operating system three years ago.  Many legacy IBM hardware had to remain, however, due to compatibility issues with the version of Oracle Financials software being used for FMSS.  Replacement of the last of the IBM machines was contingent on FMSS being upgraded to Oracle Release 12 which was completed in November 2018.  We are now completely off AIX and the old machines have been retired.

The result is that ISS continues to save and avoid hardware costs.  We were already saving approximately $600,000/year as compared to the previous architecture. With the successful upgrade of FMSS to R12, ISS is avoiding over $2M per year by not having to move the legacy servers to the new PIVOT data centers.  In addition, with the PIVOT move ISS is avoiding another $1.3M/year in data storage costs by using our own leased NetApp storage devices.  This is based on what we were paying for EDCAPS storage under EDUCATE.  Finally, the infrastructure support team successfully created new VMware clusters in Production, Non-Production, DRF environments and migrated Oracle application VMs into the new VMware clusters to limit the CPU allocation for Oracle VMs. By doing this, the Department is saving approximately 20% of Oracle licensing and support cost per year.  This was determined by working with Oracle to optimize our environment to minimize costs compared to their original proposal.

Since 2018, ICIS has evolved to include services that some states use to comply with Electronic Rule Phase 2 (eRule) data requirements to assure compliance with EPA regulations. As these services are developed, retrospectives are done to identify efficiency options and continuous improvements.  Current metrics categories (Number of DMRs, Distinct Users, ICIS Registered Users, NPDES permits, and User Reports)continue to provide overall health and usage of the integrated system.  As technology and compliance assurance needs have evolved, EPA recognizes the need to modernize its major investments which will lead to flexibility, eventual reduction in operating costs, and ability to leverage services across the enterprise.  The first step in the modernization effort will be engaging states, regions, EPA programs, other regulated entities to flush out a Concept of Operations.   In FY2021, the ICIS Modernization effort will continue the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) which will define the compliance assurance business workflow.  The CONOPS will inform the implementation of required business functions, the physical infrastructure needs, and policies. 2021-2024 primary goals for the ICIS investment will be to continue creating permit tools for multiple sectors (MSGP, CGP, MS4, PGP, etc.) for EPA general permits and state versions of the general permits for those states that selected to use EPA NeT permit tools as part of eRule Phase 2.   In addition, the ICIS investment will complete the Concept of Operations for all business functions in the compliance assurance workflow (currently ICIS NPDES, AIR, FE&C, NeTDMR, and NeT) collaborating with states, regions, EPA program areas, and other regulated entities.   The investment will also implement strategies aligned with the EPA Digital Strategy (and in one case has led the agency in implementing an ICIS function within the AZURE cloud) allowing usage of DEVSECOPS deployment workflows increasing overall efficiency of the development/deployment process and testing.","continue as-is","2021-11-30 09:32:49"

Prior to the e-Manifest system launched in June of 2018, the EPA was aware that mailed paper manifests were the most burden-intensive and expensive way for receiving facilities to comply with the statute and regulations. As such, this metric was established approximately 3 years ahead of the mailed paper manifest phaseout. 
Communications prior to system launch and the early years focused on transitioning receiving  facility submission methods from mail to methods where they upload the paper manifest into the system.
EPA headquarters sent out weekly lists of facilities mailing manifests to EPA regional and state colleagues so they would be aware and aid in the transition to a more electronic workflow. 
In the last six month before the phaseout ORCR has been working directly with facilities still submitting manifests through the mail.
Mailed paper manifests submissions have been decreasing steadily. Since system launch, on average, mailed manifest have constituted over 4% of submissions, however since December 2020, mailed manifest have not constituted more than 3% of submission per month, and in the last 2 month before the phaseout, mail submissions where less than 2% and 1% respectively. EPA has been directly working with facilities still mailing in June 2021 in order to transition to fully electronic manifesting and other submission options. 
Those who mail in paper manifests will be subject to civil penalties from OECA, as per the rule.   Resources in the paper processing center, previously working on paper manifests will now be shifted to focus on image data entry and data quality. ","continue as-is","2021-11-30 09:32:52"

IAE is operational; overall usage is increasing and delivering value to both the acquisition and assistance communities. 
Without a change in the way the IAE systems/services are managed and maintained, the costs would rise over time.  Hence the pursuit of the SAM.gov modernization aggregation strategy for improved business services, elimination of redundancy, common infrastructure, greater data sharing, and significantly lowering the cost of operation.
The continuing government focus for accountability and transparency has required additional DME efforts to ensure compliance with new statutory requirements.
The IAE services are important business services for government-wide acquisition and financial assistance processes in accordance with statutes and regulations.
Therefore the IAE requires modification and enhancement.

The essential objective of the plan established a research data warehouse containing Medicare and Medicaid claims data, Assessments data, and Part D Prescription Drug Event data, linked by beneficiary, across the continuum of care, more readily available to healthcare researchers. The CCW provides the data for the research needed to identify areas for improving the quality of care provided to chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries and ways to reduce program spending.  During 2020, the increased demands for COVID-19 related data heightened the capabilities CCW has to quickly respond and deliver relevant data to healthcare researchers.  The CCW environment continues to provide customers with the needed functionality and performance required to conduct their research. Users from CMS, CMS contractors, Federal agencies and external researchers use CCW data for research.  Data includes sources such as Part A and B Claims and Eligibility/Enrollment Files, EDB, CME, Denominator, T-MSIS, Alpha MAX, Part D, Assessments (MDS, OASIS, LTC, Swing Bed, IRF-PAI), Provider (NPPES, PECOS), Encounter, MedPAR, LDS, and PUF.
The implementation and continued extension of the cloud-native alternative analytic environment established in 2020 will bring innovative analytic capabilities for users.

On an average, HIGLAS processes 4.5 million claims daily accounting for approximately $1.4 trillion in outlays per year thus making it the largest Oracle Federal Financials System.  HIGLAS continues to enhance CMS oversight of financial operations, in order to achieve reliable, auditable, timely financial accounting, and reporting for CMS programs and activities.

The HIGLAS effort has significantly improved the ability of CMS/HHS to perform accounting transactions.  These improvements and benefits attributable to HIGLAS include reduced costs due to elimination of redundant individual Medicare financial record systems, improvements in automated Medicare debt collection/referral activities, creation of audit trails for every Medicare transaction/payment/claim in HIGLAS, improved Medicare financial audit ability, and improved capability for CMS to more systematically and efficiently recover identified Medicare overpayments.  Moreover, HIGLAS implementation has resulted in better internal financial controls across Medicare contractor operations.  Implementation of HIGLAS has a significant and positive impact on the amount of additional interest earned (saved) in the Medicare Trust Funds.  In addition, HIGLAS provided the capability for CMS and HHS to achieve compliance with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) of 1996.

The operational success of HIGLAS is instrumental to CMS and the following programs:  Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS), Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP), Federal Facilitated Marketplace (FFM), and Administrative Program Accounting (APA).","continue as-is","2022-03-09 09:20:56"

The system architecture for the HETS 270/271 now utilizes a Micro Services framework that breaks up the large, heavy compute tasks needed to process EDI transactions in to smaller much more manageable units of work.  Compute costs were reduced by implementing Lambda serverless technology, and Fargate serverless Container computing services, directly attributing to more than 30 percent of the cost savings. Through system refactoring, HETS reduced transaction processing time by as much as 1/3 (from 2.1 sec/transaction to 1.4 sec/transaction).

In line with the agile transformation, the business owner recommends expanding continuous improvement and innovation efforts. Budget baselines will be maintained with the exception of a small increase of funds to the investment for the development of the appellant portal, already approved by the Governance Review Board (GRB) and possible licensing cost associated with the EACMS Greenfield rebuild. 

The implementation of a microservice infrastructure and HCD practices to business mission aligned work streams provides the next critical step in EAOS ITs maturation as a program. The microservices infrastructure decreases dependencies, and variance between teams that can impact the schedule of value delivery to end users. HCD practices and standards enables an increased focus in HCD based product management and a more user friendly product to all end users within the Federal, Contractor and public user base. Both work to better align the program to meet CMS and OHI objectives. 

In the short term road map beyond FY21, the government looks to further enhance the HCD standing of all EAOS IT components and reduce cost of business operations by extending its appellant facing technologies to include an appellant portal, and possibly adding customer centric measurements such as target cycle time reductions for the appellant persona dependent tasks. The other key item in the short term roadmap is the EACMS Greenfield rebuild. This is to get EACMS on a more sustainable and modern footing to allow it to best leverage the appellant facing technologies also within the suite.

Not many programmers have the Prolifics/Panther nor Informix skillsets, but if they do, it is expensive ($150 - $200 per hour). By continued investing in legacy software, we have less room for innovations. CBS is in dire need of modernization to:

 *Reduce the risk of technical obsolescence
 *Strengthen Security
 *Improve efficiency and scalability
 *Develop better business workflows
 *Improve the user experience
 *Reduce O&M costs.

Next Steps:
*An alternatives analysis is currently being developed to determine the best platform available for the CBS modernization project.
*Provide a very Rough Order of Magnitude cost range to convert the old CBS system to a new one based on the updated requirements and use cases, including data conversion and hardware costs.
*Obtain approval from ITIB on modernization

 	Uptime
 	Error-free Credit Card Settlements
 	Park coverage

The following are the average actual measures for each performance metric for FY2015:  

Row Labels	Average of Actual Result
Error Free Credit Card Settlements	74.3% Error Free
Park Coverage	6
Satisfied Fee Managers	6
Uptime	74.3% Uptime

The following conclusions can be drawn from these performance metrics:

 	The goal of 100% error-free credit card settlements was not met, at an average of 74.3% error-free credit card settlements. The failures that caused errors in credit card settlements were related to infrastructural failures beyond the control of POSS at the Denver Data Center; however, they do highlight some of the infrastructure issues the program faces. 
 	Simliarly, the actual uptime result of 74.3% was short of the goal of 100%, for the same reasons described above.
 	The goal of satisfied fee managers has been consistently met; however, this metric fluxuates based upon the current stress level of the park employee s. For the majority of the measurement period all fee managers report satisfied.

The NWIS Modernization Program is necessary to address fragile legacy application replacement work that balances current WMA fiscal needs with needed technological improvements and operational priorities. Maintaining a status quo approach of not modernizing NWIS means that eventually the technical debt will grow too large to sustain the suite of applications, workflows, and processes so continued investment is necessary. The NWIS Modernization Program performs in-depth analysis of legacy features to identify which are necessary in future applications and is appropriately prioritizing those needs in a systematic fashion to ensure the entire NWIS ecosystem maintains functionality throughout the modernization efforts. The Enterprise Technology Office continues to assess and evaluate usage patterns and provide feedback on new implementations to ensure a cost effective and sustainable end state is reachable. Both the Program and ETO identified concerns around the current developer contract transition and have worked to minimize the transition, as well as ensure that the future contract can scale up appropriately to meet NWIS and other WMA needs. This contract change did result in a slowdown in activities in FY22 but allows for an accelerated development starting in FY23 with room for capacity improvement.   

The operational aspects of NWIS should be evaluated to address a splintering of applications into multiple programs and divisions to ensure common operational objectives are identified and progress is made towards achieving them.

This includes wildlife inspectors, special agents, legal assistants, evidence custodians, case management specialists, forensics lab personnel, and managers.  User/customer satisfaction is assessed using a variety of methods, but primarily through a three-pronged approach:  Formal surveys through the Footprints change management system; regular meetings with the OLE Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) committee; and, presentations/interaction at annual special agent and wildlife inspector in-service sessions, and regional administrator conferences.  In addition, LEMIS personnel meet with industry and wildlife trade representatives to assess the effectiveness of, and user satisfaction with, public accessible systems (Bird Fatality/Injury reporting program, and the electronic declarations system, eDecs).
Survey results and user/customer inputs indicate, almost exclusively, a high level of user satisfaction with respect to functionality and performance.  Usage has generally trended sharply upward in the last 10 years.  For example, more that 85% of all wildlife import/export declarations are now filed electronically through the eDecs system.  Of those eDecs, more than three quarters have user fees processed on-line/electronically.  Almost all Civil Asset Forfeiture Act (CAFRA) Notice of Seizure letters are processed using the LEMIS eCAFRA module.  The vast majority of all Violation Notices written by OLE officers are processed through the LEMIS Violation Notice module.  All OLE special agents track investigative activities through the LEMIS Activity Reporting module.

Customers have reported that they are satisfied with our performance and that the team is responsive and is helpful resolving their issues. Customers have reported that there are some issues with procuring new equipment related to IT and the time that it takes to get purchases processed. With the latest guidelines for purchasing there is a bottleneck in the process, and it takes longer to acquire hardware or services. Plans are being developed for an upgrade of the Unit Control portion of HVRSCADA. An AoA will be completed as part of this planning. Target completion dates have not yet been determined. The FMS component will undergo an install of NAS and a backup solution to provide redundancy and system stability. FMS is being evaluated to determine the best option/system for treatment of wastewater at Hoover Dam as our current system is at capacity. EACSS will complete the transition from analog to digital surveillance cameras this year. Plans are underway to replace the entire surveillance system to meet Denver Security's software standardization plan.  The system has three areas where we must maintain compliance, NERC/CIP, BOR FIST and FISMA. Our systems are frequently audited to ensure that all our processes meet compliance standards.

a.	Integration with USGS to allow transfer of park and interagency pass inventory from USGS (where the passes are stored and shipped from) to RBMS
b.	Integration with Recreation.Gov to allow RBMS devices to validate digital passes issued by Recreation.gov at the point-of-sale. 
c.	E-Commerce channel, which would allow visitors to pay fees using a QR code on their own smart phones for unstaffed locations (such as trails, small campgrounds, etc.).

In 2019, OFLC began development of the Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) to replace the legacy iCERT System.  The five modules that have been deployed under the iCERT System (i.e., LCA, PWD, H-2A, H-2B, and PJR) were modernized in 2019, and the iCERT system decommissioned. FLAG's modernization efforts have been well received by both the internal and external users. Internal DOL FLAG users have in application access to all tools and resources required to issue a decision. External filers are generally satisfied with FLAG functionality but have requested additional account types be created to improve case management at the business level. Seasonal jobs updates in real-time, as applications are accepted for processing. Between 2018, the last year applications were filed in legacy iCERT, and 2022, the number of H-2A applications has increased by 61% with 71% increase in the number of decisions issued by statutory timelines. In the same time period, the H-2B program received 51% applications, issuing 48% more decisions within regulatory timelines.

Technical Functionality Assessment and Gap Analysis: 
The FLAG team continues to implement improvements and minor enhancements to meet stakeholder needs. The team updates reference tables and stored templates, in addition to preparing the system for peak filing windows. OFLC routinely identifies minor enhancements to improve daily case adjudication and funds larger enhancements as required by regulatory or policy changes.  The number of reported FLAG bugs continues to decrease from a high of 1,580 during 2019 to 247 in 2022.  The FLAG technical team has integrated its work across multiple technical teams, adopting standard practices to ensure application availability is the priority.

Gap Analysis Summary:
The PERM system has a significant number of bugs which has forced the users to implement workarounds. There is a need to use new technologies to address system reliability, availability, and any security vulnerabilities. There is also a need to increase productivity and reduce operating costs.  A PERM modernization task order was awarded in August 2022 to integrate the PERM program into the FLAG system.","initiate modernization/replacement action","2023-01-24 09:26:44"
012,"Department of Labor",20,012-000001055,"Consumer Price Index (CPI)",2021-05-24,"CPI transitioned to a mixed life cycle investment in Q2 FY 2020. To operate, maintain, and modernize systems efficiently and effectively, CPI continues to improve by automating manual processes and by making it easier to maintain systems. Also, CPI performs maintenance work to increase data relevancy, ensure that COTS products are secure and supported, and to adhere to OMB and DOL mandates. 

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: CPI completed the Sample Maintenance System (SMS) Release 3.2 agile project at the end of FY 2021. The project supported the business need to select goods and services to price in outlets that reflect the choices of consumers, and to weigh price quotes according to their relative importance within consumer market baskets. This allows the program to better use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey by allowing for changes to the CPI item structure, Point of Purchase Survey category design, and Primary Sampling Unit design. CPI continues modernizing the collection of the CPI Housing Survey with new functionality that increases the quality of the data collected and provides an incremental step towards respondent self-reporting. CPI began work to expand data collection methods to include alternative data sources and methods, such as from corporate partners, purchasing of secondary source data, or respondent self-reporting. CPI began implementing a limited number of alternative data sources into the production systems for use in production outputs. CPI also began data collection improvements across the CPI program to acquire alternative data to allow for a centralized and scalable capability enabling uniform and consistent processes for easily ingesting data from new sources.

There are no known gaps in the Strategic & Business Results performance measures.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: The DOL CBA Tool analysis supports the existing approach to operating, maintaining, & modernizing the CPI IT investment.

INNOVATION: A key finding in the OA related to implementing Continuous Integration pipelines to reduce the burden of software deployments and to improve quality through test automation.

The investment is meeting business needs and customer satisfaction is overall positive.
The project team is tracking emerging technologies and performing ongoing analyses of alternatives for achieving the same or better customer results and strategic goals at better cost, performance, and risk levels than the current solution. They are continuing work that is improving user experience and streamlining reactor business processes. Alternatives analyses were performed in the selection of a low-code/no-code platform for NRC to inform investment decisions.
Given its engagement with strategic planning activities and its technical architecture, the investment is able to meet emerging requirements. The project team is keeping up with needs to upgrade components as they approach end-of-life and has plans in place for future modernization. The investment is also adapting to constraints on it imposed by the NEIMA legislation.
The investment is able to support long-term strategic objectives, by continuing migration of components to the cloud, leveraging the authoritative data in the data warehouse, and increasing support for data analytics activities.
It is recommended that the investment continue to assess component needs, increase the use of data analytics for decision making and transformation activities, streamline business (including end-to-end) processes, look at innovation for the complete information lifecycle, and modernize using agency IT/IM Roadmap priorities and target technologies.
It is also recommended that product owners within this investment implement more formal customer satisfaction assessments to supplement the existing informal methods, to better understand and account for the customer experience and evolving business needs. There could be benefit from looking at recent Federal user experience guidance to find further opportunities for improved service to external stakeholders and leverage tools, such as Journey Maps, for example, to gain a more end-to-end view of how the investment’s services are meeting stakeholder needs.","initiate modernization/replacement action","2022-07-27 16:29:40"

Consistent with OMB guidance that requires all steady state projects, including the steady state portion of Mixed Life Cycle investment, to be reviewed periodically, DIS is evaluated by the following metrics: customer satisfaction based on their deployment experience, direct user support, and strategic and business results. Customer Satisfaction - Users of the DIS system continue to be satisfied with the performance of the application and support from the DIS team. As FY2021 is focusing on the deployment of the DIS performance management module globally, the survey response is collected to reflect their DIS onboarding experience. Survey responses over the past 12 months have rated DIS service with an average 4.55 out of 5.0, exceeding the target metric of 3.0. In addition, the system availability metric maintained an average 99.95% uptime. Direct User Support - DIS has received over 3000 tickets in FY2021. The DIS help desk was able to resolve each high priority ticket within the service level agreement of 24 working hours. Strategic and Business Results - From the business perspective, DIS is experiencing some challenges in meeting the system decommission target of siloed monitoring and evaluation systems used by various Agency Missions. The COVID-19 outbreak and USAID's operational response have shifted priorities throughout the Agency including the Office of the CIO. Missions and DIS have deprioritized tasks related to sunsetting in-use M&E systems and the full transition to DIS, resulting in delays to decommissioning these third-party systems.","continue as-is","2021-09-16 20:32:26"

The IDA team recommends: 
- Move to a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cloud-based CM solution. This option would shift RMS away from a government-owned-and-operated solution to a vendor-developed, vendor-managed solution. With a COTS solution, the vendor maintains and supports the software. Some of the leading CM vendors are used in the Federal sector and have DoD-approved cloud offerings. Most solutions contain a mobile application for QA/QC, integrate with Autodesk and ArcGIS, and are built around industry standards making it easier to exchange data with construction contractors.
- Conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) of CM tool suites. RMS is the system of record for CM. The IDA team conducted a market survey and found several leading COTS products that fit USACE's unique CM needs. Some of the COTS products identified in the market survey are already in use in the USACE, DoD, or the Federal Government and could likely be obtained through existing contracts. Before any Request for Proposal can be made, the RMS PO should conduct an AoA to compare the operational effectiveness, suitability, and
life-cycle cost of alternative CM solutions that satisfy the established RMS capabilities.  

The stability of RMS provides USACE with the opportunity to shift to a commercial, cloud-based CM solution with little disruption. Moving to a COTS solution will require effort, but RMS can continue to operate until the shift is made. COTS solutions are already used or tested in the districts and their lessons learned should be used in selecting a COTS
product.","initiate modernization/replacement action","2023-01-31 09:38:53"

Within current funding levels, NARA is faced with a choice between a performant Catalog with poor search results, or a poor performing Catalog with improved search results. Neither of these choices is acceptable to customers. To effectively meet customer needs, NAC must be both performant and must improve search results, resulting in additional funding requirements. The NAC user interface and experience have not had any significant enhancements since 2014 and are critical to the user search experience.","initiate remediation action","2021-09-22 16:39:09"

Lack of communication as to network changes that impact DAS, results in a degradation of services that impact staff who depend on DAS for their daily operations. The workflow engine is at end of life and is being maintained on extended support. The DAS search engine is not scalable and requires significant weekly maintenance to allow searches across non-columnar fields.","initiate remediation action","2021-09-22 16:39:10"
