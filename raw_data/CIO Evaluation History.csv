In FY23, we plan to move the Electronic Non-Medical (ENM) application, used primarily by OHO to manage non-medical workloads, to EDCS, as the first step to expand ENM's case processing.

Major Accomplishment:  EDW Enterprise Scheduling Solution (ESS) MI Release

Challenge: Stakeholders of the new Enterprise Scheduling Solution (ESS) application need to be able to pull ad hoc data and generate Management Information (MI) reports from the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) to support Agency reporting needs.

Action:  The Enterprise Data Architect (EDA) performed data analysis and modeled the EDW PESS_SRC, PESS rep, and the ESS_MI schemas in order to capture and store data that will feed the new MI reports.   The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) team developed, tested and implemented these schemas in production.  The EDW team supported the ESS MI Team;s design, development and implementation of th enew ESSETL extract, transform and load (ETL) job.  The EDW team also implemented a standard IBM Infosphere Data Replication (IIDR) data pipeline that replicates the ESS programmatic data into the EDW on a scheduled basis.

Regarding Metric #200045, for the month of September 2022, the Average Speed of Answer was 126 seconds (missing the target of 30 seconds) and the TSC Service Level was 60.49% (missing the target of 80%).  The missed service level target is primarily attributed to the need for increased staffing to align with the growth of YOY contact volumes.

TSC Avg Speed of Answer was 174 sec (target of 30 sec) ; TSC Service Level was 60.52% (target of 80%). While the TSC ASA and Service level remained consistent with Nov 2022, the missed targets for Dec was largely due to a spike in volume associated with annual user recertification effort for another application coupled with the need for increased staffing to align with the growth of Year Over Year IPP contact volumes.

For June, TSC Service Level was 66.32% and Avg Speed of Answer 90 seconds. June service levels impacted by annual IPP user recertification; the primary reason is due to increase in customer contacts driven by volume related to agency onboarding efforts. TSC anticipates service levels will continue to be missed in 2022. A reevaluation of the metrics is needed to ensure the target is meaningful given the larger user base.

The Feb unit cost without overhead is higher because the Feb financials use an average of the past 3 months financial data, which includes Dec (Feb actuals are not available until after the metrics are due). Dec costs are the highest month of the year, and it skews the numbers. The Feb number is only meant to be a place holder until the actuals come in and it should be much lower than what has been estimated.

There was an issue with KISAM P1/P2 tickets in April.  There were multiple mainframe issues related to peak filing season. Other 2 issues were with low threshold in the Operations Bridge Manager (OBM) and with servers not being placed in a downtime for maintenance status correctly.  This triggered OBM to generate a false ""event"" during scheduled maintenance.  IRS has addressed these issues; assess in June.

Additionally, recent events including Russia's invasion of Ukraine coupled with a need to respond to cyber-attacks, disinformation and threats to USAID's overseas operations and partners has resulted in an increased cybersecurity and privacy risk to the Agency, the Nation, and its allies. These risks can be mitigated through continued investment in both emerging technologies and compliance driven by Federal law, regulation and policy. Technology advancements include Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) that enable predictive defense and automated remediation that, when combined with an emphasis in cyber security and privacy compliance, allow USAID to a) provide an automated and often preemptive response to the latest threats, regulations, mandates, and technical advancements; and b) increase efficiency and effectiveness of Cybersecurity Framework functions and privacy controls that are critical to maintaining cyber hygiene and risk management and are audited by various entities like OIG, GAO and other oversight entities.",N,"2022-09-15 15:41:12"
